# Minesweeper-Console
## Introduction
  My project idea was to implement the well-known Minesweeper game using a microcontroller, a joystick and an LCD screen. I was motivated to choose this project topic because Minesweeper is a game that I have enjoyed playing since childhood. The purpose of the game is entertainment. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines in the grid, using clues about the number of neighboring mines in each cell.
  In my opinion, it is a good way to have fun and relieve stress.

- The first problem I encountered was the possibility of not having enough memory to run the game, since the current state of the grid must be remembered, the previous state (many variables) and the animations on the LCD must be managed. So I decided to use the ESP32 microcontroller, which offers more RAM than the Arduino UNO, but whose pins operate at 3.3V.
